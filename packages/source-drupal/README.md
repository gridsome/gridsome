> Drupal source for Gridsome. This package is under development and API might change before v1 is released. 

### Quick Overview

This plugin currently works exclusively with [Drupal JSON:API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi). This module is becoming highly adopted and there are even talks of incorporating it into Drupal core in the future.

A thorough README is coming soon. For the time being please refer to this [pull request thread](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/pull/41) to help get you started!
