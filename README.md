### Enjoy a modern development stack
Build websites with modern tools like Vue.js, webpack and Node.js. Get hot-reloading and access to any packages from npm and write CSS in your favorite preprocessor like Sass or Less with auto-prefixing.

### Connect to any CMS or data source
Use any CMS or data source for content. Pull data from WordPress, Contentful, local Markdown, or any other headless CMS or APIs and access it with GraphQL in your pages and components.

### PWA Offline-first architecture
Only critical HTML, CSS, and JavaScript get loaded first. The next pages are then prefetched so users can click around incredibly fast without page reloads, even when offline.

### Get perfect page speed scores
Gridsome automatically optimizes your frontend to load and perform blazing fast. You get code-splitting, image optimization, lazy-loading, and almost perfect lighthouse scores out-of-the-box.

### Build future ready websites
The future of the web is JavaScript, API's, and Markup - the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). Gridsome uses the power of blazing-fast static site generator, JavaScript and APIs to create stunning dynamic web experiences.

### Ready for global domination
Gridsome sites are usually not connected to any database and can be hosted entirely on a global CDN. It can handle thousands to millions of hits without breaking - and no expensive server costs.

## Quick start

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to create a new project
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

### 3. Next steps

1. Create `.vue` components in the `./src/pages` directory to create pages
2. Use `gridsome build` to generate static files in a `./dist` folder

## How to Contribute

Install [Node.js 8.3](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a new Gridsome project inside the `./projects` folder.
3. Enter the new project folder and run `yarn install`.
4. The project will now use the local packages when you run `gridsome develop`.

Make sure your test project has a version number in its `package.json` if you use an existing project.

To use the local version of `@gridsome/cli` as the global command, enter the `./packages/cli` folder and run `npm link`.

Yarn will add dependencies from your test projects to the root `yarn.lock` file. So you should not commit changes in that file unless you have added dependencies to any of the core packages. If you need to commit it, remove your projects from the `./projects` folder temporary and run `yarn install` in the root folder. Yarn will then clean up the lock file with only necessary dependencies. Commit the file and move your projects back and run `yarn install` again to start developing.
